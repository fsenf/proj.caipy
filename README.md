# Caipy Tools

Python tools for the calculation of convective aggregation indices (atmospheric science.


## Background

The research paper  Pscheidt, I, Senf, F, Heinze, R, Deneke, H, Trömel, S, Hohenegger, C. How organized is deep convection over Germany?. Q J R Meteorol Soc. 2019; 145: 2366– 2384.https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3552 analyzes satellite and radar data using a set of python tools.

The content of the repository are Python scripts and modules related to the work in the mentioned paper. It is what I could recover after some years - hope it is somehow consist the applied methods.
